# simple_GBGP
To archive my old code of simple and naive implementation of Grammar Based Genetic Programming in Common Lisp, with test problem of six multiplexor toy problem. 

This was written years ago as a fun little exercise in coding that I recently revisit.

Probably the coding style does not represent best practice, and the code may need some cleaning.
